# README #

**write.io** (codename) is a collaborative writing game. You connect to the server (via browser, no install needed). The server then quickly matches you with a few fellow players to form a new writing group. All members of the writing group are online now, and start collaborating on writing a new story. The game works in rounds: in each round, players suggest different continuations to the current, ongoing story.

Every player sees in real time what every other player is writing, and can vote on his preferred continuation to the current plot. Once a particular continuation gets enough votes, it gets added to the ongoing story, and the round finishes (round often take around one minute). When a player suggests “The End” of the story, and his suggestions gets enough votes, the game and the story end.

The end result is a collaboratively created story.
